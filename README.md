**Project:** Building a Data Pipeline for E-commerce Analytics

**Scenario:** You are working for an e-commerce company that wants to analyze customer purchase data to gain insights into buying patterns and optimize inventory management.

#### Steps and Deliverables

**1. Apache Nifi: Data Ingestion Pipeline**
   - **Goal:** Ingest customer purchase data from various sources (CSV files, APIs) and store it in a staging area.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Install Apache Nifi and create a flow to ingest data from a CSV file.
     - Use Nifi processors to clean and transform the data.
     - Store the transformed data in a staging database (PostgreSQL).
   - **Deliverable:** Apache Nifi flow configuration file and a brief report with screenshots and explanations.

**2. Python Programming: Data Transformation and ETL**
   - **Goal:** Use Python to further clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Write Python scripts to read data from the staging database.
     - Perform data cleaning (handling missing values, data type conversions).
     - Transform the data into a suitable format for analytics and load it into a PostgreSQL analytics database.
   - **Deliverable:** Python scripts and a report detailing the ETL process.

**3. PySpark: Large-Scale Data Processing**
   - **Goal:** Process and analyze large datasets using PySpark.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Set up a PySpark environment.
     - Write PySpark scripts to perform data aggregation (e.g., total sales per product, average purchase value per customer).
     - Save the processed data back into the PostgreSQL analytics database.
   - **Deliverable:** PySpark scripts and a summary of the data processing tasks performed.

**4. PostgreSQL: Database Management and Query Optimization**
   - **Goal:** Manage and optimize the PostgreSQL database for fast query performance.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Set up PostgreSQL databases for staging and analytics.
     - Create tables, indexes, and write queries to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently.
     - Optimize queries for better performance and ensure the database is well-structured.
   - **Deliverable:** SQL scripts and a report detailing the database setup, queries written, and performance optimizations.

**5. DataLake Experience: Cloud Storage and Analysis**
   - **Goal:** Implement a Data Lake to store raw and processed data, enabling advanced analytics.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Create a Data Lake on AWS/Azure/Google Cloud.
     - Ingest raw data into the Data Lake and perform basic operations.
     - Use cloud analytics tools (e.g., AWS Athena, Azure Data Lake Analytics) to query the data.
   - **Deliverable:** A report on the Data Lake setup, data ingestion process, and queries performed.

**6. Cloud Experience: Deploying and Managing Cloud Services**
   - **Goal:** Deploy and manage cloud services to support the data pipeline and analytics platform.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Set up cloud resources (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets on AWS, or equivalent on other platforms).
     - Deploy the PostgreSQL database and Nifi instance on the cloud.
     - Use cloud monitoring and management tools to ensure the system's reliability and performance.
   - **Deliverable:** A summary of the cloud services used, applications deployed, and any challenges faced.
